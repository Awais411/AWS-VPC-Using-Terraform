## Terraform Configuration for AWS VPC

This repository contains Terraform code to provision a basic AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the following features:

- **Multiple Availability Zones:** Spreads resources across availability zones for redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Private and Public Subnets:** Provides both isolated private subnets for internal resources and public subnets with internet access for web servers or applications requiring external communication.
- **Optional NAT Gateway:** Enables internet access for resources in private subnets through a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway (default: `true`).
- **Optional VPN Gateway:** Allows secure site-to-site connectivity to your VPC (default: `true`). Disabling it reduces complexity but removes VPN access.

**Prerequisites:**

- Terraform installed and configured: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)
- AWS credentials with sufficient permissions to create VPC resources: [https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/managing-user-credentials/](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/managing-user-credentials/)

**Important Security Considerations:**

- **Never commit access keys and secret keys** to version control. Use environment variables or other secure methods to store and access credentials.
- **Review access policies** for your IAM users to ensure they have the least privilege required for provisioning resources.
- **Consider security groups and network access control lists (ACLs)** to further restrict traffic flow within your VPC and subnets.

**Usage:**

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awais411/AWS-VPC-Using-Terraform.git
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   cd aws-vpc-terraform
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the execution (dry run):**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   Review the planned changes carefully before applying.

4. **Apply the configuration (create resources):**

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Destroy resources (optional):**
   
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

**Outputs:**

After applying the configuration, Terraform will display outputs like VPC ID, subnet IDs, and public IP address of the NAT Gateway (if enabled).

**Additional Notes:**

- This is a basic example. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements.
- For more complex VPC configurations, consider using Terraform modules for reusability.
- Explore other Terraform features like provisioners and data sources for more comprehensive infrastructure management.

**Contributing:**

Pull requests are welcome! Please follow best practices for Terraform code readability and maintainability.

By following these guidelines, you'll have a well-structured and informative README.md file that effectively documents your Terraform code for your AWS VPC setup. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual details and consider using more secure credential management practices.
